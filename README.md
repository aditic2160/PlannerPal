# PlannerPal

PlannerPal is a **purely frontend React application** designed to help students stay organized, manage tasks, take notes, collaborate, and track their schedules in one centralized platform. The app is lightweight, easy to use, and focuses on improving productivity without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Features

PlannerPal offers multiple tools for academic organization:

- **Home Page:** A welcoming dashboard explaining the app's purpose and features.  
- **To-do List:** Create, edit, and delete tasks with due dates and estimated completion times. Mark tasks as completed and track total estimated time for all assignments.  
- **Notes:** Add, edit, and delete notes for classes or projects. Supports multiple notes with timestamps.  
- **Forum/Blog:** Share questions, ideas, and homework challenges with other students. Users can create posts and comment on existing posts.  
- **Schedule:** Manage daily activities by adding events with descriptions, times, and AM/PM periods. Edit and delete events as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.  
- **CSS** – Styling for global and component-specific layouts.  

> This app is purely frontend—there is **no backend or database**. All data exists only in the current browser session.
